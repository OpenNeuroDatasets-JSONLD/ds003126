This dataset contains the raw 3 Tesla fMRI data and T1 structural images of 58 children: 22 children with typical reading and spelling skills, 16 children with isolated spelling deficits (SpD) and 20 children with dyslexia. 
This dataset was used for the paper " Reading-related functional activity in children with isolated spelling deficits and dyslexia", which is currently under review. 
Stimuli consisted of 60 words and 60 matched pseudohomophones of three to eight letters. Each stimulus was presented alone in white on a black background for 3s in an event-related design. After it disappeared, a fixation cross was displayed. The presentation of the fixation cross was jittered between 2000 and 6000 ms (M = 4000 ms). To prevent fatigue effects in children, stimuli were presented over three consecutive runs of 40 items each, separated by short breaks of 3-5 min. Children were instructed to read aloud the stimuli appearing on the screen. 

The codes of children included in the analysis are listed hereafter:
